# Gesture and voice controlled DAW
Exploratory use of gesture and voice control in the interaction between sound technician and DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). The prototype allows for bodily interaction with the sound material, which encourages better listening focus and fewer visual distractions. The prototype is programmed in Processing and utilizes color tracking via camera input and voice control via Google Chrome. These inputs are translated into MIDI signals which are forwarded to a DAW (Logic Pro X). Through gesture and voice commands, one can control volume, panning, as well as the tools compressor, equalizer, and reverb. [See a demonstration of the prototype in use here.](https://www.thomaseg.dk/)
